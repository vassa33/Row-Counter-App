# Row-Counter-App
A simplistic App made using HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript

> Using this app, you are able to count how many rows you have created or there are so far by using the `increment` button.
> Use the `decrement` button to correct your count as need be
> Finally, use the `save` button to track your count every step of the way by recording your values

If named otherwise, this app can easily be a passenger counter, a grocery counter or simply just a counter for anything.
